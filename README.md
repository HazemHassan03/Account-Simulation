# Account Simulation
I have created a project that acts as a personal account on a website. I developed this page using HTML and CSS, making it fully responsive on all devices using Flexbox, Grid, and Media Queries.

The project contains 8 pages: Dashboard, Settings, Profile, Projects, Courses, Friends, Files, and Plans.

Each page includes:

- A sidebar with the logo and navigation links that lead to their respective pages.

- A header with a search bar that expands when clicked, a notification icon for account notifications, and the account owner's profile image.

- Multiple widgets displaying information or performing functions.

- A customized scrollbar specifically for the widget section, not the entire page.

- A scrollbar appears in the sidebar if it extends more than the device's height.

- Customized checkboxes and radio buttons using pure CSS, with unique animations and add changes on them in the profile page.

- A unified progress bar used across applicable pages.

- Active highlighting of the current page's link in the sidebar.

- Interactive animations for most page elements, so interact now with every item in the pages to see what happens.

- A responsive design where the sidebar shrinks on tablets and mobile phones to provide more space for page content.

- Each page has its own favicon, title, and CSS file, and global styles are in the master.css file.
